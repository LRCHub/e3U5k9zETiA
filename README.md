[00:00.70] darkness locks me into this room
[00:04.19] the air I breathe has never felt so cold
[00:07.26] and I'm losing hold of everything I had
[00:10.66] so I'll rock myself to sleep
[00:13.74] her beautiful smile was always just for him
[00:17.01] every corner of her heart was filled with her love for him
[00:20.97] even when the time would come to say goodbye
[00:23.91] this is what she'd say:
[00:26.32] "there's nothing to cry for, I want you to know that
[00:29.64] as long as it's you, this pain couldn't hurt me
[00:32.94] no reason to regret, I'll always be waiting for you
[00:36.71] my love, oh
[00:39.65] it'll be alright, I want you to know that
[00:42.98] I'll always believe in the truth of your words
[00:46.13] the only thing unreal was
[00:49.66] my place in your heart"
[01:03.65] she could feel his words wrap around her neck
[01:06.09] her very last breath was swallowed into silence
[01:10.23] and everything they had together fell away
[01:13.26] this is how their story ends
[01:16.87] surrounded by an iron barricade
[01:19.05] gazing at the light with eyes of lead
[01:23.46] even after all the time gone by
[01:26.90] this is what he'd say:
[01:29.27] "I look at these hands that are stained with blood and
[01:32.63] they'll never bring back all the things that they took
[01:35.60] so I won't turn back, I'll find you again someday
[01:40.77] I know, oh
[01:43.25] if only the tears would erase all the memories
[01:46.52] then maybe I'd learn to fight all these fears
[01:49.00] won't hesitate, won't run away
[01:53.45] these are things I'm scared to say"
[02:23.21] as he is standing in light that is fading
[02:26.07] he's feeling the trembling beat of his heart
[02:29.61] and he remembers the sound of her very last words
[02:33.06] again, again
[02:36.18] "there's nothing to cry for, I want you to know that
[02:39.39] as long as it's you, this pain couldn't hurt me
[02:42.87] no reason to regret, I'll always be waiting for you
[02:46.00] my love, my love
[02:49.03] it'll be alright, I want you to know that
[02:52.81] I'll always believe in the truth of your words"
[02:56.01] with open arms, he looks to the sky
[02:59.68] finally, I've found my way
[03:02.60] my way to you, my way to you
