Darkness locks me into this room
the air I breathe
has never felt so cold and I'm
losing hold
of everything I had
so I'll lock myself to sleep
Her beautiful smile
was always just for him
every corner of her heart
was filled with her love for him
Even when the time
would come to say goodbye
this is what she'd say:
“There's nothing to cry for,
I want you to know that
as long as it's you,
this pain couldn't hurt me
No reason to regret,
I'll always be waiting for you
my love
oh
It'll be alright,
I want you to know that
I'll always believe
in the truth of your words
The only thing
unreal was
my place in your heart”
She could feel his words
wrap around her neck
her very last breath was
swallowed into silence and
everything they had
together fell away
This is how their story ends
Surrounded by an iron barricade
gazing at the light
with eyes of lead
even after all the time gone by
this is what he'd say:
“I look at these hands that
are stained with blood and
they'll never bring back
all the things that they took
so I won't turn back,
I'll find you again someday
I know
oh
If only the tears would
erase all the memories
then maybe I'd learn to
fight all these fears
won't hesitate,
won't run away
these are things
I'm scared to say…”
As he is standing
in light that is fading
he's feeling the trembling beat
of his heart
and he remembers
the sound of her very last words
again again
“There's nothing to cry for,
I want you to know that
as long as it's you,
this pain couldn't hurt me
No reason to regret,
I'll always be waiting for you
my love
my love
It'll be alright,
I want you to know that
I'll always believe
in the truth of your words”
With open arms,
he looks to the sky
finally, I've found my way
my way to you
my way to you
