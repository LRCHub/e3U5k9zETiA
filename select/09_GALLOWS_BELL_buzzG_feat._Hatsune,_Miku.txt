Darkness locks me into this room
The air I breathe has never felt so cold
And I'm losing hold of everything I had
So I'll rock myself to sleep
Her beautiful smile was always just for him
Every corner of her heart was filled with her love for him
Even when the time would come to say goodbye
This is what she'd say
There's nothing to cry for
I want you to know that
As long as it's you, this pain couldn't hurt me
No reason to regret, I'll always be waiting for you
My love
Oh
It'll be alright
I want you to know that
I'll always believe in the truth of your words
The only thing unreal was my place in your heart
She could feel his words wrap around her neck
Her very last breath was swallowed into silence
And everything they had together fell away
This is how their story ends
Surrounded by an iron barricade
Gazing at the light with eyes of lead
Even after all the time gone by
This is what he'd say
I look at these hands that are stained with blood and
They'll never bring back all the things that they took
So I won't turn back, I'll find you again someday
I know
Oh
If only the tears would erase all the memories
Then maybe I'd learn to fight all these fears
Won't hesitate, won't run away
These are things I'm scared to say
As he is standing in light that is fading
He's feeling the trembling beat of his heart
And he remembers the sound of her very last words
Again
Again
There's nothing to cry for
I want you to know that
As long as it's you, this pain couldn't hurt me
No reason to regret, I'll always be waiting for you
My love
My love
It'll be alright
I want you to know that
I'll always believe in the truth of your words
With open arms, he looks to the sky
Finally, I've found my way
My way to you, my way to you
